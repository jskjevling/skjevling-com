This is a javascript module I developed for pinning content to a location on screen and dropping back into document flow when the content is reached.

It was originally developed for persistent safety text for pharmaceutical websites.

It has some elaborate features since it was destined for consumer-facing sites.  It has it's own scrolling implementation with velocity on mobile devices to avoid bounce and other issues (mostly iOS-related) that cause undesired functionality.  

You can check it out at the [GitHub repo][isi-gh].
