It has been quite the year. I think I might still be absorbing it all. This has been a year of massive growth, as well as massive upset, from macrocosm to microcosm.

It's been a bit like being compressed through the eye of the needle while simultaneously crossing through a chaos node that's bending time and space in impossible ways all the while.

As one of the many elements of this transition, I have found myself wanting a more efficient and effective means of communication with the online community. And since my personal website, redesigned over two years ago, was beginning to look a little long in the tooth, I figured this would be the perfect time to revamp.

I've been disliking the performance of WordPress for my particular needs for a while now, and have been wanting a more efficient approach to blogging and content sharing. In addition to this, I've been wanting to add a streamlined e-commerce solution to my site.

The solution I've arrived at is a static implementation based on Jekyll with Foundation integrated for templating.  While I think I will be able to spend some time paring down the code (I use almost none of the Foundation components in this design) it's a great start.

I owe a thanks to Chris (core77) for his [starter project][gh.starter], which saved me quite a bit of initial setup time.

All-in-all, the development has only taken about two days, and that includes porting the old content over from my previous site.

The ease with which this setup allows me to write new posts is pretty fantastic, and the liquid templates make for incredibly easy componentization.

I'm still working on the snipcart implementation for print and merch sales, but I should have that complete in rather short order.

Here's to a fresh start in 2017 and the hope of a less chaotic experience in the new year.  Let us hope we can survive this final month and cross the threshold in one piece.
