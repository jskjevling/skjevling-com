After a fair bit of consideration, I went ahead and released a significant stash of old material in the form of a fake-ish anthology.

It is a 2 CD set and covers material from 1998 - 2010.  It's called Assertion and Repetition: 20 Years of Middle Room and you can find it [here][cd-baby-link].

It has a running time of over two hours and a purchase price of under $15, so hopefully it feels like getting your money's worth.

In response to the favorable reception for this work, I have begun the slow process of recording new Middle Room material.  I'll be reporting more on that in the near future.
