For quite a long time I have been experimenting with various tuning systems in my music. I noticed long ago that the effects of the underlying tonality of a musical piece can have drastic implications for the experience of the listener, even when the perception is subtle.  Resultantly, I have spent quite a bit of time experimenting with different tonalities and tunings.

Most recently I have moved to tuning systems that are only subtlely different from standard tuning, but the effects, for those sensitive to them, can be distinct and important.

In this article, I thought it may be interesting to break down the fundamentals of the tuning I return to most frequently these days which is based on Gurdijeff's law of octaves.
