I think I might still be absorbing it all. This has been a year of massive growth, as well as massive upset, from macrocosm to microcosm.</p> <p>It’s been a bit like being compressed through the eye of the needle while simultaneously crossing through a chaos node that’s bending time and space in impossible ways all the while.</p> <p>As one of the many elements of this transition, I have found myself wanting a more efficient and effective means of communication with the online community. And since my personal website, redesigned over two years ago, was beginning to look a little long in the tooth, I figured this would be the perfect time to revamp.</p> <p>I’ve been disliking the performance of WordPress for my particular needs for a while now, and have been wanting a more efficient approach to blogging and content sharing. In addition to this, I’ve been wanting to add a streamlined e-commerce solution to my site.</p> <p>The solution I’ve arrived at is a static implementation based on Jekyll with Foundation integrated for templating. While I think I will be able to spend some time paring down the code (I use almost none of the Foundation components in this design) it’s a great start.</p> <p>I owe a thanks to Chris (core77) for his <a href="https://github.com/core77/jekyll-foundation">starter project</a>, which saved me quite a bit of initial setup time.</p> <p>All-in-all, the development has only taken about two days, and that includes porting the old content over from my previous site.</p> <p>The ease with which this setup allows me to write new posts is pretty fantastic, and the liquid templates make for incredibly easy componentization.</p> <p>I’m still working on the snipcart implementation for print and merch sales, but I should have that complete in rather short order.</p> <p>Here’s to a fresh start in 2017 and the hope of a less chaotic experience in the new year. Let us hope we can survive this final month and cross the threshold in one piece.</p> <p>-J</p> </p> </article> </div> </main> <footer> <nav> <p class="copy">&copy; 2017 Subsystem Industries, LLC</p> </nav> </footer> <script src="/assets/js/all.js"></script> <script> (function(i,s,o,g,r,a,m){i['GoogleAnalyticsObject']=r;i[r]=i[r]||function(){ (i[r].q=i[r].q||[]).push(arguments)},i[r].l=1*new Date();a=s.createElement(o), m=s.getElementsByTagName(o)[0];a.async=1;a.src=g;m.parentNode.insertBefore(a,m) })(window,document,'script','https://www.google-analytics.com/analytics.js','ga'); ga('create', 'UA-50164763-1', 'auto'); ga('send', 'pageview'); </script> </body> </html>
